# Desktop Sidecar

The sidecar owns the renderer-facing Desktop Local API and the process-owned
connection to remote OpenEvo Core. The canonical public contract is defined once
in `contracts/v1/app.py`; release implementations must use its provider injection
point instead of registering another route table.

## Release Local Provider: Phase One

`release_app.create_release_desktop_local_api_app()` creates the real Local API v1
application. It owns one `DesktopProviderStore` for the process lifetime and
requires the native host to supply a Desktop session token, native instance ID,
readiness key, source commit, and private state root.

This phase implements:

- public `GET /version` with `provider_kind=desktop_sidecar` and the canonical
  OpenAPI digest;
- challenge-bound `GET /health` using HMAC-SHA256 over
  `protocol NUL instance_id NUL challenge`;
- constant-time Desktop session authentication for every `/desktop/v1/*` route;
- `GET /desktop/v1/state` with an explicit disconnected Core state;
- profile and project list/create/get/patch/delete through
  `DesktopProviderStore`, including durable idempotency, signed cursors, ETags,
  and restart recovery.

No SSH or Core operation is claimed by this slice. Connection actions,
activation, validation, operations, runs, artifacts, services, diagnostics,
maintenance, and events return a closed `ApiErrorV1` with HTTP 503. They never
return fixture data or a synthetic ready/success state.

## Provider Extension

`DesktopLocalApiProviderV1.invoke()` receives the canonical OpenAPI
`operation_id` and the already validated endpoint arguments. The release
provider has a small handler map only for implemented operations; unknown
operations fail closed. Later SSH and Core providers should add verified
handlers behind this interface while keeping the decorators and signatures in
`contracts/v1/app.py` authoritative.

Provider and request-validation failures are normalized by `release_app.py`.
Error responses must remain user-safe: do not include local paths, SQLite
messages, credentials, session tokens, remote commands, or backend URLs.
